# Learning Vue From Scratch
This repository contains my notes and projects as I learn Vue.js from scratch. It includes tutorials, code examples, and practical applications to help solidify my understanding of Vue.js concepts and best practices.

## Command for generate base Vue app
```bash
  vue create LearningVueFromScratch
```

I used the above command to generate the base Vue application structure:
```bash
  npm init vue@latest .
```
because i already had a folder created named LearningVueFromScratch

## How to run the project
To run the Vue.js application locally, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash 
  cd ./root/to/LearningVueFromScratch
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
  npm run dev
```
